<p>Welcome to the Getting Started Moxle! This example is designed to show off a simple server hosted on the <a href="https://modulus.io/" target="_blank">Modulus platform</a>. Its nothing fancy, just serving up some static files as well as providing a few test endpoints for your enjoyment.</p>

<p>The application uses <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a> as its web server, which is quite possibly the most popular choice these days. Utilizing this framework we can define static assets, create custom routes, and even set up caching and sessions. The <a href="/ping" target="_blank"><code>/ping</code></a> route provides a quick health check and summary for this server, so go ahead and check it out.</p>

<p>Most sites typically need to display ever-changing information, so we have included <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank">Handlebars</a> into our stack, via the <a href="https://github.com/donpark/hbs" target="_blank">hbs</a> module. Very lightweight and simple to implement with Express, Handlebars gives us a way to easily take advantage of dynamic pages. You can visit the <a href="/template"><code>/template</code></a> page for details on how it all works.</p>

<p>Since Modulus fully supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket" target="_blank">WebSockets</a>, we have also added a small <a href="http://socket.io/" target="_blank">socket.io</a> server to exercise the real-time/streaming capabilities of Node.js and WebSockets. This mockup is accessed via <a href="/heartbeat"><code>/heartbeat</code></a> route, which opens up a websocket connection and streams heartbeats from connected clients.</p>
